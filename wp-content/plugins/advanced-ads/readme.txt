Manage and optimize your ads and ads performance with support for AdSense, ad injection, ad widget, and ad rotation.

== Displaying Ads ==

You can use functions and shortcodes to display ads and ad groups.

The integers in this example are the IDs of the elements.

Use these shortcode to insert an ad or ad group into your post/page.

`[the_ad id="24"]`
`[the_ad_group id="5"]`

Use these functions to insert an ad or ad group into your template file.

`<?php the_ad(24); ?>`
`<?php the_ad_group(5); ?>`

In addition to directly displaying ads and groups you can define ad placements and assign either an ad or group to them.

`[the_ad_placement id="header-left"]`
`<?php the_ad_placement('header-left'); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a revenue share? =

There is no revenue share. Advanced Ads doesn’t alter your ad codes in a way that you earn less than you would directly including the ad code in your template.

== Screenshots ==

2. Support for all kinds of ad types, including dedicated AdSense type. AMP is included in the Responsive add-on.
3. Flexible ad input with the Plain Text ad type.
4. Align your ads within the content.
5. Choose from various conditions where and to whom to display your ads.
